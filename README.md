# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The goal was to create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type then create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fare for each city type. With all this information, we can help the decision-makers at PyBer become more efficient and profitable.

## Results

Right off the bat, there were roughly 2.5x and 13x more rides in urban cities than suburban and rural cities, respectively. Similarly, the number of drivers in the urban cities more than quadrupled the total drivers in the other two city types combined. Although the total fares is somewhat proportional to those previous relationships, the average fare per ride and driver is flipped so that the rural cities actually see higher fares and payouts.

## Summary

The disparities among the average fares between the city types is probably due to rural riders needing to travel further distances, hence having to pay more. To "even" out the average fare per ride, the CEO could increase the base fare and/or lower the milage fee to get a higher output from the short commuters in the city. 
Another option to increase overall revenue would be to silently hike the prices up during the last week of the month to double up on a continued pattern of fare spikes during those times.
